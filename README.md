# AndroidThreading-Java
This Android concurrency project involves creating an application with a single activity and using Threads and Handlers. The application will use a HeavyWork class with a getNumber() method that will be executed in the background. The user will set the complexity of the heavy work using a SeekBar and the selected number will define how many times the getNumber() method is executed in the background thread. A thread pool of size 2 will be created and used to execute the created thread. The Handler class will be used to exchange messages between the child thread and the main thread. Tapping on the “Generate” button will start the execution of a background thread that will compute a list of numbers and report progress updates, which should be displayed on the UI.
